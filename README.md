This project provides an interactive visualization of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial based on user-defined points on a 2D graph. Users can add, move, and delete points on the canvas, and the program dynamically recalculates and redraws the interpolating polynomial in real-time as points are added, moved, or removed. Click to add points, drag to move them, and right-click to delete. Includes basic coordinate system with axes using math to screen and screen to math.
